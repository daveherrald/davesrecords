# Commit, Push, and Create PR

Commit current changes, push to a new branch, and create a pull request.

## Context
```bash
git status
git diff --stat
git log --oneline -3
```

## Instructions

1. Review the staged and unstaged changes above
2. Create a descriptive branch name from the changes (e.g., `fix/audit-log-exposure`, `feat/add-dark-mode`)
3. Stage all relevant changes
4. Write a clear commit message following conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
5. Push to the new branch
6. Create a PR with:
   - Clear title
   - Summary section with bullet points
   - Test plan section

Do NOT push directly to main. Always create a feature branch.
